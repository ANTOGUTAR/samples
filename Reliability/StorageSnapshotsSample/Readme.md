## Storage resiliency code samples 


In this set of files we provide sample Powershell scripts for creating a snapshot of a blob and a File share, as well as a sample script for copying blobs from one storage account to another; we also include the ARM tmeplate to deploy the storage account and related resources.

Before running any of these samples, deploy the ARM template included in file StorageAccountTemplate.json

Use this command:

New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name> -TemplateFile StorageAccountTemplate.json

### Sample Scripts


Sample 1 included in PS script Blob-Snapshots.ps1, shows how to create a snapshot of a blob. Include the  ResourceGroupName param

Blob-Snapshots.ps1 -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName>

Sample 2 included in PS script azcopy-blob-containers.ps1, shows how to copy all the blobs included in a blob container from one storage account to another.

Sample 3 included in PS script FileShare-Snapshot.ps1, shows how request a snaphot of a fileShare 

FileShare-Snapshot.ps1 -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName>
